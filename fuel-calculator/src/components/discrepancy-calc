First you need to find the average of fuel put in between the bowser in kg
and the aircraft in kg. 
So 
    bowser in Kg + difference in AC start and finish / 2 = average of fuel put in. 
    Divide that by 100 gives you 1% of fuel put in.

After that you need to work out the difference between the bowser in kg and AC put in. 
Divide that by 1% and that will give you the discrepancy.
